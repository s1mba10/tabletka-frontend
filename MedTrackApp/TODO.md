# Here is plans for app

- ~~Add changing weeks by swiping screen where weeks are. And add changing days on other part of screen where scheduled reminders are. So I can change weeks not only with arrows and days not only by tapping on the day.~~
- Объединить созданные приемы в группы которые будет видно как курсы принятые в препаратах(наверное) и можно будет повторить.
- Either remove profile photo or add opportunity to add it. Same with the name.
- Find out why vscode is highlighting lines under @ts-ignore in files ReminderEdit.tsx and ReminderAdd.tsx.
- When I delete reminder and i change days to some other day and to this day after that I see that fantom reminder which does not exist but showing for a sec on screen somewhere. I also want to remove sliding when I am tapping on screen at all, even if the days are close to each other. I should see sliding only when I tap arrows to change weeks and when I am sliding the screen.

BACKLOG

- ~~When we create reminders for many days by day of the week buttons of days of the week should be a little bit bigger, days should start from Monday, not Sunday (Пн not Вс) like this Пн Вт Ср Чт Пт Сб Вс~~
- ~~Date format for buttons for scheduling for many days when we create reminders should be in dd-MM-yyyy~~
- ~~Start and stop when we create reminder should be visible only if we choose to repeat for many days. If not - by default for one day (selected day).~~
- ~~When I press Остановить my active course, all reminders of this course should be deleted.~~
