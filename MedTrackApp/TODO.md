# Here is plans for app
- Full Calendar Picker for selecting dates to schedule. And full calendar when tapping on week and year date to select where to go. 
- Add dynamic island with timer progress bar when it is time to take reminder. 
- Checking that field medication name is not empty
- Either remove profile photo or add opportunity to add it. Same with the name.
- Find out why vscode is highlighting lines under @ts-ignore in files ReminderEdit.tsx and ReminderAdd.tsx.
- Add changing weeks by swiping screen where weeks are as in Mirea app. And add changing days on other part of screen where scheduled reminders are. So I can change weeks not only with arrows and days not only by tapping on the day.
- When I delete reminder and i change days to some other day and to this day after that I see that fantom reminder which does not exist but showing for a sec on screen somewhere. I also want to remove sliding when I am tapping on screen at all, even if the days are close to each other. I should see sliding only when I tap arrows to change weeks and when I am sliding the screen.
- Make icons displayed correctly.

BACKLOG

- ~~Объединить созданные приемы в группы которые будет видно как курсы принятые в препаратах(наверное) и можно будет повторить.~~
- ~~When we create reminders for many days by day of the week buttons of days of the week should be a little bit bigger, days should start from Monday, not Sunday (Пн not Вс) like this Пн Вт Ср Чт Пт Сб Вс~~
- ~~Date format for buttons for scheduling for many days when we create reminders should be in dd-MM-yyyy~~
- ~~Start and stop when we create reminder should be visible only if we choose to repeat for many days. If not - by default for one day (selected day).~~
- ~~When I press Остановить my active course, all reminders of this course should be deleted.~~
- ~~Fix problematic navigation with main screen~~
- ~~If medication course was last one day we should allow user which day to plan it. I am thinking about adding to ReminderAdd screen if один раз is selected to choose in one date picker (as when we choose other options except один раз) what day to schedule it to by default today.~~
